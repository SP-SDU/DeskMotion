## Contributing 🤝

For a smooth collaboration process, please use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/):
- **Note:**  Forking is creating a personal copy of the repository. It's used when you don't have write access to the repository.

1. **Clone:** Open GitHub Desktop, go to `File > Clone Repository`, and paste:
   ```
   https://github.com/SP-SDU/DeskMotion
   ```
2. **Branch**: Switch to `main` using the branch switcher, create a new branch for your feature. Name it after the JIRA issue key and feature, e.g., `CurrentFeature`.
3. **Commit:** Enter your commit message in the `Summary (required)` field and click `Commit`.
4. **Push:** Click `Push origin` to upload your changes to GitHub.
5. **Pull Request:** On GitHub, create a `New pull request` against `main`, fill in the details, and submit.
6. **Request a Review:** Tag a teammate in your pull request for a review.
7. **Stacking:** Instead of waiting for approval, continue working on another feature based on your current feature work. On your **feature branch** (not main), create a new branch `Current Branch > New Branch` for the next feature, e.g., `NextFeature`.
